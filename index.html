            <div class="subtext">In an unspecified amount of millennia into the future, the world has long been ravaged by a cataclysm thousands of years 
                ago, there exists a refuge on this ruined Earth -- a Domed City named "Romdeau" where humans and their android servants, the AutoReivs, live 
                in a state of controlled peace. This constructed paradise that houses its wealthy citizens and unfortunate immigrants is ruled by a Regent 
                and his governing council. They demand that complete order and servitude is kept within Romdeau to keep chaos at its gates at bay. However, 
                this utopian landscape is soon shattered by a series of horrifying murders. Re-L Mayer, a female inspector from the Citizen Information Bureau, 
                along with her AutoReiv entourage Iggy, are tasked to solve the murder cases. When Re-L and Iggy investigate the latest crime scene, Re-L is attacked 
                by a mysterious creature, neither human nor AutoReiv, that is seemingly drawn to her. She begins to learn the truth about the mysterious creatures 
                that are simply referred to as "Proxies" and what they truly are.

        <div class="quote">"From the perspective of others I am part of the world, but when I observe the world from my perspective I am nowhere to be found. To observe is to create perspective. I can never cease to be the point of origin from my perspective. I observe that which is not myself. This is the first principle to find."
